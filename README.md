# RedfinFiltersTest
assigned interview test for acorns 

Thank you for taking the time to consider me for this position.  I learned a lot while progressing through the assignment.  

Notes:

1. The townhouse_filter_test fails due to 'Ready to build' properties showing in the results.  I believe this is a bug, but I 
    could not reproduce it manually during a short test run.  Maybe I need to slow down the click actions?
2. The house_filter_test also fails for the same reason as the townhouse_filter_test does.  Multiple 'Ready to build' properties
   are shown in the results.
   
I wish I had more time to work on this and I probably will in my free time.  Thank you in advance for any feedback you provide,
it is much appreciated.  I am really trying to improve myself as a QA engineer.
